Needs Updating - MaNGOLin is a standalone (does not require a webserver) administration frontend for the MaNGOS (Massive Network Game Object Server).

MaNGOLin is not a GUI restarter its main function is remote administration to be run on a separate machine other than the host server although it will run perfectly well on the same machine as your host server.
MaNGOLin was originally designed to run on Linux but now also runs on Windows 7/Vista/XP and it is available for free under the GPL 2 License, all source code is included.
